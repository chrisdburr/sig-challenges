The current schema is functional, but it could be extended for richer data capture and potentially better application functionality:

    Flexible Capabilities: Replace capability1, capability2, capability3 with a single capabilities array. This allows for a variable number of associated capabilities (0 to many) and removes the arbitrary limit of 3.

        Schema Change:


        "capabilities": {
          "type": "array",
          "description": "List of AI-DT capability IDs associated with the challenge",
          "items": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": [
              "system_modelling",
              "data_integration",
              // ... all capability IDs
              "vvuq"
            ]
          },
          "minItems": 1 // Ensure at least one capability is listed
        },

    Benefit: More flexible and accurate representation of how capabilities relate to challenges.

Rationale Field: Add an optional rationale field (string) to allow for brief justifications for the assigned ratings (Significance, Complexity, Readiness) or other relevant context not captured in the main description.

    Schema Change: Add "rationale": { "type": "string", "description": "Optional justification or context for ratings or challenge definition" } to the properties of a challenge item.

    Benefit: Increases transparency and understanding behind the ratings and definitions.

Related Challenges: Add an optional related_challenges field (array of integers) to explicitly link challenges that are interdependent or closely related.

    Schema Change: Add "related_challenges": { "type": "array", "description": "Optional list of numbers of related challenges", "items": { "type": "integer" } } to the properties.

    Benefit: Allows users/applications to easily navigate interconnected challenges, understanding the broader context.

Date Tracking: Add date_added and last_updated fields (using format: date or date-time).

    Schema Change: Add "date_added": { "type": "string", "format": "date", "description": "Date the challenge was initially added" } and "last_updated": { "type": "string", "format": "date", "description": "Date the challenge was last modified" }. Make them required or optional as needed.

    Benefit: Useful for maintenance, tracking the evolution of the challenge list, and showing data currency.

Source/Reference: Add an optional references field (array of strings or objects) to cite sources, relevant papers, or projects related to the challenge.

    Schema Change: Add "references": { "type": "array", "description": "Optional list of references or sources", "items": { "type": "string" } } or define a reference object structure.

    Benefit: Provides evidence and pathways for users to explore challenges in more depth.

Rating Confidence: Introduce an optional field like rating_confidence (e.g., enum: High, Medium, Low) to indicate the level of certainty in the assigned S/C/R ratings, acknowledging subjectivity.

    Schema Change: Add "rating_confidence": { "type": "string", "enum": ["High", "Medium", "Low"], "description": "Optional confidence level in the assigned S/C/R ratings" }.

    Benefit: Adds nuance and acknowledges potential subjectivity or areas where ratings might be debated.
